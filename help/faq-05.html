	  <p>The following list represents a number of axioms according to which JBroFuzz defines and uses fuzzing concepts. 
</p>

<ul><li> A fuzzer is a set of payloads
</li><li> The algorithm that defines how the payloads of a fuzzer get combined in sequential order, defines the type of fuzzer
</li><li> A prototype is the base form description (a bit like a signature) from which a fuzzer can be created
</li></ul>
<p>Ergo within JBroFuzz, prototype definitions are stored in a file called fuzzers.jbrf. Each prototype corresponds to a fuzzer, containing information such as the type of fuzzer, the number of payloads it has, etc. 
</p><p>Finally, a fuzzing database is collection of fuzzers, as constructed by a set of prototypes. Welcome to the org.owasp.jbrofuzz.core library!

      <p>This is an internal file within JBroFuzz and can be found inside the JBroFuzz.jar java archive. </p>

      <p></p>
	  <p>In the win32 and msi releases for every version, they are embedded inside the executable, would not recommend pulling them from there.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>In the jar release, you can find all fuzzer definitions within the file 'fuzzers.jbrf' in the root directory of the compressed jar file. Rename the JBroFuzz.jar to JBroFuzz.zip and access as a normal zip archive to obtain and modify the file.</p>

	  <p><i>"Fuzzing is a methodology for finding flaws in a protocol by crafting
			different types of packets for that protocol which contain data that
			pushes the protocol's specifications to the point of breaking them, and
			sending these packets to a system capable of receiving that protocol,
			and finally monitoring the results."</i></p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>The above definition focuses more on protocols and packets, within the JBroFuzz documentation you will find:</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p><i>"JBroFuzz has attempted to expose the intrinsic beauty of the subject: Constantly submit a vast amount of payloads to a service, device or prompt, waiting for the one response that makes all the difference. This is the mentality that JBroFuzz embraces and attempts to offer back to security professionals."</i></p>
