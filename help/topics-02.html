<h1>Graphing Tab &nbsp;</h1>
<p>This tab graphs any data collected during fuzzing. This tab can offer a clear indication of a response that is different then the rest received, an indication of further examination being required. </p>

    <td><p>Getting Started: Having selected the graphing tab, click <em>&quot;Start&quot;</em> in the tool bar menu. Select one of the directories, right click <em>&quot;Graph&quot;</em> in order to generate all the graphs for that fuzzing session. </p></td>

      <td width="70%"><p>The following graphs are available:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Status Code Pie Chart </strong> A pie chart with all the different type of response status codes (e.g. 200, 404, etc.) received for each request sent. If no status code could be identified, the value <em>&quot;---&quot; </em>will be included in the chart. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Response Time Bar Chart &nbsp;</strong>A bar chart with the response time from beginning to send each request, to closing the respective connection after receiving the data. Each response is measured in milliseconds. A negative value indicates that the file's response time could be read.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Response Size Bar Chart &nbsp;</strong>A bar chart with the response size for each request, measured in bytes. This does not include  any of the comments placed on the top of the file, indicating the request sent in JBroFuzz format.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Jaccard Index</strong> A bar chart with the Jaccard similarity coefficient, in the range of [0, 1]. Based on the characters of the first response received, the ratio of the intersection of the unique characters in the current response with the unique characters in the first response, over the union of the unique characters in the current response with the first response. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" width="100%" align="center" 
      bgColor=#c0c0c0 border=0>

          </tr>
        </table> <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Hamming Distance </strong>A bar chart with the hamming distance of the characters in the response, relative to the first response received. Check each character of the first response received, against the character at the same position of the current response received. If they are not identical, increment the hamming distance. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Response Header &nbsp;</strong>A bar chart with the response header size for each request, measured in bytes. This does not include any of the comments placed on the top of the file, indicating the request sent in JBroFuzz format.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </td>
      <td valign="top" width="30%" bgcolor="#8080ff"><h3>Jaccard Index </h3>
        <p>As a ratio of what is common with the first response, over what is available, measuring the Jaccard index on the character level for each response, can give a clear indication of a different response received. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Hamming Distance</h3>
        <p>Measuring the Hamming distance on the character level for each response received and, relative to the first response shows the number of characters that are different at each part of the response. </p>
