<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">JBroFuzz 
is a stateless network protocol fuzzer that emerged from the needs of 
penetration testing. JBroFuzz's design emphasizes simplicity and ease-of-use. We 
are attempting to get you to cover the basics in terms of penetration testing 
for web applications by&nbsp; means of creating malformed data and having the 
network protocol in question consume the data.</font> </p>
