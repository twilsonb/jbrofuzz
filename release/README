- JBroFuzz Downloads & Versions
=================================================

For each release of JBroFuzz, there are typically
three (3) files made available:

jbrofuzz-win32-{xx}.zip
jbrofuzz-jar-{xx}.zip
jbrofuzz-{xx}.msi

Where {xx} represents the version number. As an 
example, jbrofuzz-jar-25.zip would correspond to
JBroFuzz version 2.5 . 

If you are reading this file, you have probably
downloaded jbrofuzz-jar-{xx}.zip .

=================================================
- Installing JBroFuzz on (*nix)
=================================================

Obtain a copy of the latest jbrofuzz-jar-{xx}.zip

Typically, we like to store things in /opt, ergo

bash-3.00# mkdir /opt/jbrofuzz
bash-3.00# unzip jbrofuzz-jar-{xx}.zip
bash-3.00# mv examples /opt/jbrofuzz
bash-3.00# mv JBroFuzz.jar /opt/jbrofuzz
bash-3.00# mv jbrofuzz.sh

Now you can quickly test JBroFuzz, by issuing:

bash-3.00# java -jar JBroFuzz.jar

=================================================
- Running JBroFuzz on (*nix)
=================================================

With each download of the standalone jar file 
(i.e. jbrofuzz-jar-{xx}.zip, see section above)
there is a corresponding shell script available.

The script to run is jbrofuzz.sh; a rather basic
flavour, performing a `which java` and passing
some jvm parameters.

This script needs to be chmod-ed in order for 
JBroFuzz to run correctly. If you have followed
the instructions above and have placed the
release of JBroFuzz in /opt/jbrofuzz, issue the
following:

bash-3.00# cd /opt/jbrofuzz
bash-3.00# chmod 744 /opt/jbrofuzz/jbrofuzz.sh
bash-3.00# ./jbrofuzz.sh

You will be required to have a java 1.6 JRE or
JDK installed. 

For more information on java, see the INSTALL 
file:
